Project Objective:-

The project objective is to create a COVID-19 vaccine tracker dashboard that will provide users with a comprehensive view of the global vaccination effort. The dashboard will track vaccination progress by country, region, and demographic group. It will also provide users with insights into the factors that are driving vaccination rates, such as vaccine availability, public awareness, and government policy.

The dashboard will be built using Tableau, a data visualization software platform. The data for the dashboard will be sourced from a variety of public data sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

The dashboard will be divided into three main sections:

Global Vaccination Progress: This section will provide users with an overview of the global vaccination effort. It will track the number of people who have been vaccinated, the number of doses that have been administered, and the vaccination rate by country. Regional Vaccination Progress: This section will provide users with a more granular view of the vaccination effort by region. It will track vaccination progress in each WHO region, as well as in key countries within each region. Demographic Vaccination Progress: This section will provide users with insights into the factors that are driving vaccination rates by demographic group. It will track vaccination rates by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The dashboard will be a valuable resource for policymakers, health care providers, and the general public. It will provide users with a comprehensive view of the global vaccination effort and insights into the factors that are driving vaccination rates. The dashboard will help to inform decision-making and improve the effectiveness of the global vaccination effort.

The dashboard will include data on the following points:

People vaccinated: This could be broken down into two categories: fully vaccinated and partially vaccinated. Countrywise vaccinated: This could show the vaccination rate by country, as well as the number of people who have been vaccinated in each country. GDP per capita effects on vaccination: This could show how GDP per capita affects vaccination rates. For example, countries with higher GDP per capita may have higher vaccination rates. People vaccinated per hundred: This could show the vaccination rate per hundred people in each country. The dashboard will also include data on other factors that may affect vaccination rates, such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

The dashboard will be updated on a regular basis to reflect the latest data. It will also be made available in multiple languages. The dashboard will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide audience.
